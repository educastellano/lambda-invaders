lambda-invaders
===============
Version of the Space Invaders game.

This game was made just to learn some [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [lambda calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).

The code is not in english, and some of the functions could've written better, using second-order logic.
